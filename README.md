# Connect4Solver

This is a connect4 opponent. I couldn't find an open source solution to the game, so here you go.

<b>Setup</b>:

Fork this repo

From Connect4Solver directory: 
```
python main.py
```


<b>Implementation overview</b>

  The value of each move is estimated with through a minimax search with the heuristic based on an MCMC process. 
  
<b>TODO</b>

-Implement alpha-beta pruining for effieicency 



This opponent is not a perfect solver (it won't tie itself) but I haven't beaten it yet. Try to beat it!
